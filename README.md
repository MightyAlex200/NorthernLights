The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know because I built it.

I don't know what this is going to be, if anything other than a fun little project thingy that'll remain underdeveloped and incomplete until the assembly of magnetic charges that make these files gets torn away from each other or changed in such a way that it would be impossible to re-assemble them due to the laws of thermodynamics
